; part two, let's look at a few assumptions about the data
; first, there's exactly one empty node (17 6) capacity 89T
; our target data G is currently in (33 0) sized 71T
; every node has at least 85T capacity
; nodes with >500T capacity are too full to use

; so, given G in the top-right, its goal is to get to 0,0
; the cost of each move is the cost of emptying the node that
; we want to move to.
;
; so, this starts to look like two embedded A* search problems
; the outer one is relatively simple to figure out cost functions
; for
;
; the inner one is, what's the quickest way to empty any node?
; well, that looks like a search problem finding the quickest
; path of the empty node to the target node.
;
; permissible moves for the empty node are any adjacent nodes
; that can be swapped with.
;
; we can start by transforming the grid into dots, hashes and G

;
; pertinent part of grid is this-

; .................................G
; ..................................
; ..................................
; ..................................
; ..................................
; ........##########################
; ................._................

; grid looks like this. you can actually
; then hand calculate how far it needs
; to go.
; from 17 6 to 32 0, going around the
; wall at (8 5)
;
; 17-801 = 10 to the left to reach (7 6)
; 6-0    = 6 up to reach (7 0)
; 32-7   = 25 to the right to reach (32 0)
; total  = 41
;
; then we cost what it takes to move each
; G left.
; to get G to (1 0) with the underscore
; to its left, we need 5 moves per x move of G
; so 33-1 = 32 x 5 = 160
; plus one more to move G = 161
; so total = 41 + 161 = 202
